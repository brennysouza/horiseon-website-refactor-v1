# Module 1 Challenge 

## Description
My motivation was to enhance the accesibility of this webpage by editing and rewriting certain code in the html and css. 
I built this project because it needed some revisions. HTML was not semantic, css was not organized, and there was an issue with a nav bar link on the website header. 
This project helped solve the issue of writing semantic html code, cleaning out and orgaizing css code, the importance of commenting out css code, and how to fix webpage issues to ensure everything functions and works properly the way it was intended to do so (i.e. nav bar links on header).
I learned a few things:
- Coding takes time
- It is essential for any developer to ensure that all websites are accessible
- SEO should be priortized not only for benefits of users with disabilities and appairments, etc, but also the clients we work for so that their final product can reach more people on the web
- I learned that CSS should be organized
- After the release of HTML5, HTML code should be semantic instead of just using div tags everywhere. This also helps keep html organized and helps developrs understand what is going on. 
- Refactoring code helps with website accessibility
- This is a common task for front end and junior developers

## Installation
N/A

## Usage 
When you open this website, a landing page appears.
The only functional parts of this website are the three links in the headers nav bar.
You may click on any and it will direct you to its corresponding section in the main section of the body. Each link is an important factor of the business and helps readers understand what Horiseon offers as a business to its clients.
